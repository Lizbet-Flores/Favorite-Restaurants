        <h1>Welcome to my Favorite Restaurants Page!</h1>
        <p>This site is all about where I love to go out in the valley.</p>
        <h2>Here are some places I love to travel to:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li><strong>Cocina Madrigal</strong></li>
            <p>This small restaurant hidden in South Phoenix has the best authentic tacos. I definitely recommend trying their steak or chicken tacos whenever you're feeling something spicy.</p>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Phở Thành Restaurant</strong></li>
            <p>Vietnamese food is my ultimate favorite! This spot is another hidden gem in the valley with a boba & ice cream spot that's open right next door.</p>
           <br>
            <li><strong>The Oink Cafe</strong></li>
            <p>Up next is The Oink Cafe. This spot is a bacon themed breakfast joint. I typically visit the location in North Phoenix, but the Tempe location is not too bad either.</p>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sushiholic</strong></li>
            <p>The only sushi & Japanese grill I like is located in East Phoenix. This spot has unique rolls & plates.</p>
            <br>
            <li><strong>The Kettle Black</strong></li>
            <p>This is a great Gastropub located in Downtown Phoenix.</p>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Red Devil Italian Restaurant</strong></li>
            <p>Lastly, Red Devil is one of my favorite pizzarias because of their brick oven cooked pies. They also have great cannolis!</p>
        </ul>
